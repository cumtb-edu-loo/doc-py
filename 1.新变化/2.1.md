## 概述¶

本文介绍了 Python 2.1 的新增特性。 虽然 2.1 的改变没有 Python 2.0 那么多，但是仍然有一些令人惊喜的东西。 2.1 是第一个使用 Python 增强提议，即 PEP 来进行引导的发行版，因此大部分重要的改变都有相应的 PEP 来提供有关改变的更完整文档和设计思路。 本文并未试图完整记录所有的新特性，而是为 Python 程序员提供新特性的简单概览。 请参阅 Python 2.1 文档，或特定的 PEP，获取针对你感兴趣的任何新特性的更多细节。

Python 开发团队的一个近期目标是加速新发行版的步调，使得每 6 到 9 个月就有一个新发行版。 2.1 是基于这个新步调推出的第一个发行版，第一个内测版将于一月发布，即 2.0 最终版发布 3 个月之后。

Python 2.1 的最终版本于2001年4月17日发布。

## PEP 227: 嵌套的作用域¶

Python 2.1 中的最大改变是 Python 的作用域规则。 在 Python 2.0 中，任意给定的时刻至多使用三个命名空间来查找变量名称：局部、模块和内置命名空间。 这往往会导致令人吃惊的结果因为它与人们直觉上的预期不相匹配。 例如，一个嵌套的递归函数将不起作用:
~~~
    
    
~~~python
def f():
    ...
    def g(value):
        ...
        return g(value-1) + 1
    ...
~~~

函数 `g()` 将总是引发 [`NameError`](3.标准库/exceptions.md#NameError "NameError") 异常，因为名称 `g` 的绑定既不在局部命名空间中也不在模块级命名空间中。 这在实践上不会有太大问题（你会经常这样递归地定义内部函数吗？），但是这也会让 [`lambda`](6.%20表达式.md#lambda) 表达式的使用更为笨拙，这在实践上是有问题的。 在使用了 [`lambda`](6.%20表达式.md#lambda) 的代码中你经常能发现局部变量通过作为参数的默认值被拷贝。

    
    
~~~python
def find(self, name):
    "Return list of any entries equal to 'name'"
    L = filter(lambda x, name=name: x == name,
               self.list_attribute)
    return L
~~~

结果将会严重损害以高度函数式风格编写的 Python 代码的可读性。

Python 2.1 最显著的改变是增加了静态作用域这一语言特征来解决此问题。 作为它的第一项影响，在上述示例中的 `name=name` 默认参数现在将不再必要。 简单地说，当一个函数内部的给定变量名没有被赋值时（通过赋值语句，或者 [`def`](8.%20复合语句.md#def), [`class`](8.%20复合语句.md#class) 或 [`import`](7.%20简单语句.md#import) 语句），对该变量的引用将在外层作用域的局部命名空间中查找。 对于该规则的更详细解释，以及具体实现的分析，请参阅相应的 PEP。

对于同时在模块层级和包含下层函数定义的函数内部局部变量使用了相同变量名的代码来说这项改变可能会导致一些兼容性问题。 不过这看来不太可能发生，因为阅读这样的代码本来就会相当令人困惑。

此项改变的一个附带影响是在特定条件下函数作用域内部 `from module import *` 和 `exec` 语句将不允许使用。 Python 参考手册已经写明 `from module import *` 仅在模块最高层级上是可用的，但此前 CPython 解释器从未强制实施此规则。 作为嵌套作用域具体实现的一部分，将 Python 源码转为字节码的编译器会生成不同的代码来访问某个包含作用域内的变量。 `from module import *` 和 `exec` 会使得编译器无法正确执行，因为它们会向局部命名空间添加在编译时还不存在的名称。 为此，如果一个函数包含带有自由变量的函数定义或 [`lambda`](6.%20表达式.md#lambda) 表达式，编译器将通过引发 [`SyntaxError`](3.标准库/exceptions.md#SyntaxError "SyntaxError") 异常来提示。

为了使前面的解释更清楚，下面是一个例子:

    
    
~~~
x = 1
def f():
    # The next line is a syntax error
    exec 'x=2'
    def g():
        return x
~~~

包含 `exec` 语句的第 4 行有语法错误，因为 `exec` 将定义一个名为 `x` 的新局部变量，它的值应当被 `g()` 访问。

这应该不会是太大的限制，因为 `exec` 在多数 Python 代码中都极少被使用（而当它被使用时，往往也是个存在糟糕设计的信号）。

Compatibility concerns have led to nested scopes being introduced gradually; in Python 2.1, they aren't enabled by default, but can be turned on within a module by using a future statement as described in [**PEP 236**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0236/). (See the following section for further discussion of [**PEP 236**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0236/).) In Python 2.2, nested scopes will become the default and there will be no way to turn them off, but users will have had all of 2.1's lifetime to fix any breakage resulting from their introduction.

## PEP 236: __future__ 指令¶

The reaction to nested scopes was widespread concern about the dangers of breaking code with the 2.1 release, and it was strong enough to make the Pythoneers take a more conservative approach. This approach consists of introducing a convention for enabling optional functionality in release N that will become compulsory in release N+1.

The syntax uses a `from...import` statement using the reserved module name [`__future__`](../library/__future__.md#module-__future__ "__future__: Future statement definitions"). Nested scopes can be enabled by the following statement:
~~~
    
    
~~~
from __future__ import nested_scopes
~~~

While it looks like a normal [`import`](7.%20简单语句.md#import) statement, it's not; there are strict rules on where such a future statement can be put. They can only be at the top of a module, and must precede any Python code or regular `import` statements. This is because such statements can affect how the Python bytecode compiler parses code and generates bytecode, so they must precede any statement that will result in bytecodes being produced.

## PEP 207: 富比较¶

In earlier versions, Python's support for implementing comparisons on user-defined classes and extension types was quite simple. Classes could implement a `__cmp__()` method that was given two instances of a class, and could only return 0 if they were equal or +1 or -1 if they weren't; the method couldn't raise an exception or return anything other than a Boolean value. Users of Numeric Python often found this model too weak and restrictive, because in the number-crunching programs that numeric Python is used for, it would be more useful to be able to perform elementwise comparisons of two matrices, returning a matrix containing the results of a given comparison for each element. If the two matrices are of different sizes, then the compare has to be able to raise an exception to signal the error.

In Python 2.1, rich comparisons were added in order to support this need. Python classes can now individually overload each of the `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`, `==`, and `!=` operations. The new magic method names are:

运算

|

方法名称  
  
---|---  
  
`<`

|

`__lt__()`  
  
`<=`

|

`__le__()`  
  
`>`

|

`__gt__()`  
  
`>=`

|

`__ge__()`  
  
`==`

|

`__eq__()`  
  
`!=`

|

`__ne__()`  
  
(The magic methods are named after the corresponding Fortran operators `.LT.`. `.LE.`, &c. Numeric programmers are almost certainly quite familiar with these names and will find them easy to remember.)

Each of these magic methods is of the form `method(self, other)`, where `self` will be the object on the left-hand side of the operator, while `other` will be the object on the right-hand side. For example, the expression `A < B` will cause `A.__lt__(B)` to be called.

Each of these magic methods can return anything at all: a Boolean, a matrix, a list, or any other Python object. Alternatively they can raise an exception if the comparison is impossible, inconsistent, or otherwise meaningless.

The built-in `cmp(A,B)` function can use the rich comparison machinery, and now accepts an optional argument specifying which comparison operation to use; this is given as one of the strings `"<"`, `"<="`, `">"`, `">="`, `"=="`, or `"!="`. If called without the optional third argument, `cmp()` will only return -1, 0, or +1 as in previous versions of Python; otherwise it will call the appropriate method and can return any Python object.

There are also corresponding changes of interest to C programmers; there's a new slot `tp_richcmp` in type objects and an API for performing a given rich comparison. I won't cover the C API here, but will refer you to [**PEP 207**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0207/), or to 2.1's C API documentation, for the full list of related functions.

## PEP 230: 警告框架¶

Over its 10 years of existence, Python has accumulated a certain number of obsolete modules and features along the way. It's difficult to know when a feature is safe to remove, since there's no way of knowing how much code uses it \--- perhaps no programs depend on the feature, or perhaps many do. To enable removing old features in a more structured way, a warning framework was added. When the Python developers want to get rid of a feature, it will first trigger a warning in the next version of Python. The following Python version can then drop the feature, and users will have had a full release cycle to remove uses of the old feature.

Python 2.1 adds the warning framework to be used in this scheme. It adds a [`warnings`](../library/warnings.md#module-warnings "warnings: Issue warning messages and control their disposition.") module that provide functions to issue warnings, and to filter out warnings that you don't want to be displayed. Third-party modules can also use this framework to deprecate old features that they no longer wish to support.

例如，在 Python 2.1 中 `regex` 模块已被弃用，因此导入它时会打印一条警告信息:
~~~
    
    
~~~shell
>>> import regex
__main__:1: DeprecationWarning: the regex module
         is deprecated; please use the re module
>>>
~~~

警告可以通过调用 [`warnings.warn()`](warnings.md#warnings.warn "warnings.warn") 函数来发出:

    
    
~~~
warnings.warn("feature X no longer supported")
~~~

第一个形参是警告消息；额外的可选形参可被用来指定一个专门的警告类别。

Filters can be added to disable certain warnings; a regular expression pattern can be applied to the message or to the module name in order to suppress a warning. For example, you may have a program that uses the `regex` module and not want to spare the time to convert it to use the [`re`](re.md#module-re "re: Regular expression operations.") module right now. The warning can be suppressed by calling

    
    
~~~
import warnings
warnings.filterwarnings(action = 'ignore',
                        message='.*regex module is deprecated',
                        category=DeprecationWarning,
                        module = '__main__')
~~~

This adds a filter that will apply only to warnings of the class [`DeprecationWarning`](3.标准库/exceptions.md#DeprecationWarning "DeprecationWarning") triggered in the [`__main__`](__main__.md#module-__main__ "__main__: The environment where top-level code is run. Covers command-line interfaces, import-time behavior, and ``__name__ == '__main__'``.") module, and applies a regular expression to only match the message about the `regex` module being deprecated, and will cause such warnings to be ignored. Warnings can also be printed only once, printed every time the offending code is executed, or turned into exceptions that will cause the program to stop (unless the exceptions are caught in the usual way, of course).

Functions were also added to Python's C API for issuing warnings; refer to PEP 230 or to Python's API documentation for the details.

## PEP 229: 新的构建系统¶

When compiling Python, the user had to go in and edit the `Modules/Setup` file in order to enable various additional modules; the default set is relatively small and limited to modules that compile on most Unix platforms. This means that on Unix platforms with many more features, most notably Linux, Python installations often don't contain all useful modules they could.

Python 2.0 added the Distutils, a set of modules for distributing and installing extensions. In Python 2.1, the Distutils are used to compile much of the standard library of extension modules, autodetecting which ones are supported on the current machine. It's hoped that this will make Python installations easier and more featureful.

Instead of having to edit the `Modules/Setup` file in order to enable modules, a `setup.py` script in the top directory of the Python source distribution is run at build time, and attempts to discover which modules can be enabled by examining the modules and header files on the system. If a module is configured in `Modules/Setup`, the `setup.py` script won't attempt to compile that module and will defer to the `Modules/Setup` file's contents. This provides a way to specific any strange command-line flags or libraries that are required for a specific platform.

In another far-reaching change to the build mechanism, Neil Schemenauer restructured things so Python now uses a single makefile that isn't recursive, instead of makefiles in the top directory and in each of the `Python/`, `Parser/`, `Objects/`, and `Modules/` subdirectories. This makes building Python faster and also makes hacking the Makefiles clearer and simpler.

## PEP 205: 弱引用¶

Weak references, available through the [`weakref`](../library/weakref.md#module-weakref "weakref: Support for weak references and weak dictionaries.") module, are a minor but useful new data type in the Python programmer's toolbox.

Storing a reference to an object (say, in a dictionary or a list) has the side effect of keeping that object alive forever. There are a few specific cases where this behaviour is undesirable, object caches being the most common one, and another being circular references in data structures such as trees.

For example, consider a memoizing function that caches the results of another function `f(x)` by storing the function's argument and its result in a dictionary:
~~~
    
    
~~~
_cache = {}
def memoize(x):
    if _cache.has_key(x):
        return _cache[x]

    retval = f(x)

    # Cache the returned object
    _cache[x] = retval

    return retval
~~~

This version works for simple things such as integers, but it has a side effect; the `_cache` dictionary holds a reference to the return values, so they'll never be deallocated until the Python process exits and cleans up. This isn't very noticeable for integers, but if `f()` returns an object, or a data structure that takes up a lot of memory, this can be a problem.

Weak references provide a way to implement a cache that won't keep objects alive beyond their time. If an object is only accessible through weak references, the object will be deallocated and the weak references will now indicate that the object it referred to no longer exists. A weak reference to an object _obj_ is created by calling `wr = weakref.ref(obj)`. The object being referred to is returned by calling the weak reference as if it were a function: `wr()`. It will return the referenced object, or `None` if the object no longer exists.

This makes it possible to write a `memoize()` function whose cache doesn't keep objects alive, by storing weak references in the cache.

    
    
~~~
_cache = {}
def memoize(x):
    if _cache.has_key(x):
        obj = _cache[x]()
        # If weak reference object still exists,
        # return it
        if obj is not None: return obj

    retval = f(x)

    # Cache a weak reference
    _cache[x] = weakref.ref(retval)

    return retval
~~~

The [`weakref`](3.标准库/weakref.md#module-weakref "weakref: Support for weak references and weak dictionaries.") module also allows creating proxy objects which behave like weak references --- an object referenced only by proxy objects is deallocated -- but instead of requiring an explicit call to retrieve the object, the proxy transparently forwards all operations to the object as long as the object still exists. If the object is deallocated, attempting to use a proxy will cause a `weakref.ReferenceError` exception to be raised.

    
    
~~~
proxy = weakref.proxy(obj)
proxy.attr   # Equivalent to obj.attr
proxy.meth() # Equivalent to obj.meth()
del obj
proxy.attr   # raises weakref.ReferenceError

## PEP 232: 函数属性¶

In Python 2.1, functions can now have arbitrary information attached to them. People were often using docstrings to hold information about functions and methods, because the `__doc__` attribute was the only way of attaching any information to a function. For example, in the Zope web application server, functions are marked as safe for public access by having a docstring, and in John Aycock's SPARK parsing framework, docstrings hold parts of the BNF grammar to be parsed. This overloading is unfortunate, since docstrings are really intended to hold a function's documentation; for example, it means you can't properly document functions intended for private use in Zope.

Arbitrary attributes can now be set and retrieved on functions using the regular Python syntax:
~~~
    
    
~~~python
def f(): pass

f.publish = 1
f.secure = 1
f.grammar = "A ::= B (C D)*"
~~~

The dictionary containing attributes can be accessed as the function's [`__dict__`](stdtypes.md#object.__dict__ "object.__dict__"). Unlike the [`__dict__`](stdtypes.md#object.__dict__ "object.__dict__") attribute of class instances, in functions you can actually assign a new dictionary to [`__dict__`](stdtypes.md#object.__dict__ "object.__dict__"), though the new value is restricted to a regular Python dictionary; you _can't_ be tricky and set it to a `UserDict` instance, or any other random object that behaves like a mapping.

## PEP 235: 在大小写不敏感的平台上导入模块¶

Some operating systems have filesystems that are case-insensitive, MacOS and Windows being the primary examples; on these systems, it's impossible to distinguish the filenames `FILE.PY` and `file.py`, even though they do store the file's name in its original case (they're case-preserving, too).

In Python 2.1, the [`import`](../reference/simple_stmts.md#import) statement will work to simulate case-sensitivity on case-insensitive platforms. Python will now search for the first case-sensitive match by default, raising an [`ImportError`](../library/exceptions.md#ImportError "ImportError") if no such file is found, so `import file` will not import a module named `FILE.PY`. Case-insensitive matching can be requested by setting the [`PYTHONCASEOK`](../using/cmdline.md#envvar-PYTHONCASEOK) environment variable before starting the Python interpreter.

## PEP 217: 交互模式显示钩子¶

When using the Python interpreter interactively, the output of commands is displayed using the built-in [`repr()`](../library/functions.md#repr "repr") function. In Python 2.1, the variable [`sys.displayhook()`](../library/sys.md#sys.displayhook "sys.displayhook") can be set to a callable object which will be called instead of [`repr()`](../library/functions.md#repr "repr"). For example, you can set it to a special pretty-printing function:
~~~
    
    
~~~shell
>>> # Create a recursive data structure
... L = [1,2,3]
>>> L.append(L)
>>> L # Show Python's default output
[1, 2, 3, [...]]
>>> # Use pprint.pprint() as the display function
... import sys, pprint
>>> sys.displayhook = pprint.pprint
>>> L
[1, 2, 3,  <Recursion on list with id=135143996>]
>>>

## PEP 208: 新的强制转换模型¶

How numeric coercion is done at the C level was significantly modified. This will only affect the authors of C extensions to Python, allowing them more flexibility in writing extension types that support numeric operations.

Extension types can now set the type flag `Py_TPFLAGS_CHECKTYPES` in their `PyTypeObject` structure to indicate that they support the new coercion model. In such extension types, the numeric slot functions can no longer assume that they'll be passed two arguments of the same type; instead they may be passed two arguments of differing types, and can then perform their own internal coercion. If the slot function is passed a type it can't handle, it can indicate the failure by returning a reference to the `Py_NotImplemented` singleton value. The numeric functions of the other type will then be tried, and perhaps they can handle the operation; if the other type also returns `Py_NotImplemented`, then a [`TypeError`](../library/exceptions.md#TypeError "TypeError") will be raised. Numeric methods written in Python can also return `Py_NotImplemented`, causing the interpreter to act as if the method did not exist (perhaps raising a [`TypeError`](../library/exceptions.md#TypeError "TypeError"), perhaps trying another object's numeric methods).

## PEP 241: Python 包中的元数据¶

A common complaint from Python users is that there's no single catalog of all the Python modules in existence. T. Middleton's Vaults of Parnassus at `www.vex.net/parnassus/` (retired in February 2009, [available in the Internet Archive Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/web/20090130140102/http://www.vex.net/parnassus/)) was the largest catalog of Python modules, but registering software at the Vaults is optional, and many people did not bother.

As a first small step toward fixing the problem, Python software packaged using the Distutils **sdist** command will include a file named `PKG-INFO` containing information about the package such as its name, version, and author (metadata, in cataloguing terminology). [**PEP 241**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0241/) contains the full list of fields that can be present in the `PKG-INFO` file. As people began to package their software using Python 2.1, more and more packages will include metadata, making it possible to build automated cataloguing systems and experiment with them. With the result experience, perhaps it'll be possible to design a really good catalog and then build support for it into Python 2.2. For example, the Distutils **sdist** and **bdist_*** commands could support an `upload` option that would automatically upload your package to a catalog server.

You can start creating packages containing `PKG-INFO` even if you're not using Python 2.1, since a new release of the Distutils will be made for users of earlier Python versions. Version 1.0.2 of the Distutils includes the changes described in [**PEP 241**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0241/), as well as various bugfixes and enhancements. It will be available from the Distutils SIG at <https://www.python.org/community/sigs/current/distutils-sig/>.

## 新增和改进的模块¶

  * Ka-Ping Yee contributed two new modules: `inspect.py`, a module for getting information about live Python code, and `pydoc.py`, a module for interactively converting docstrings to HTML or text. As a bonus, `Tools/scripts/pydoc`, which is now automatically installed, uses `pydoc.py` to display documentation given a Python module, package, or class name. For example, `pydoc xml.dom` displays the following:
    
        Python Library Documentation: package xml.dom in xml
    
    NAME
        xml.dom - W3C Document Object Model implementation for Python.
    
    FILE
        /usr/local/lib/python2.1/xml/dom/__init__.pyc
    
    DESCRIPTION
        The Python mapping of the Document Object Model is documented in the
        Python Library Reference in the section on the xml.dom package.
    
        This package contains the following modules:
          ...
~~~

`pydoc` also includes a Tk-based interactive help browser. `pydoc` quickly becomes addictive; try it out!

  * Two different modules for unit testing were added to the standard library. The [`doctest`](doctest.md#module-doctest "doctest: Test pieces of code within docstrings.") module, contributed by Tim Peters, provides a testing framework based on running embedded examples in docstrings and comparing the results against the expected output. PyUnit, contributed by Steve Purcell, is a unit testing framework inspired by JUnit, which was in turn an adaptation of Kent Beck's Smalltalk testing framework. See <https://pyunit.sourceforge.net/> for more information about PyUnit.

  * The [`difflib`](difflib.md#module-difflib "difflib: Helpers for computing differences between objects.") module contains a class, `SequenceMatcher`, which compares two sequences and computes the changes required to transform one sequence into the other. For example, this module can be used to write a tool similar to the Unix **diff** program, and in fact the sample program `Tools/scripts/ndiff.py` demonstrates how to write such a script.

  * [`curses.panel`](curses.panel.md#module-curses.panel "curses.panel: A panel stack extension that adds depth to  curses windows."), a wrapper for the panel library, part of ncurses and of SYSV curses, was contributed by Thomas Gellekum. The panel library provides windows with the additional feature of depth. Windows can be moved higher or lower in the depth ordering, and the panel library figures out where panels overlap and which sections are visible.

  * The PyXML package has gone through a few releases since Python 2.0, and Python 2.1 includes an updated version of the [`xml`](xml.md#module-xml "xml: Package containing XML processing modules") package. Some of the noteworthy changes include support for Expat 1.2 and later versions, the ability for Expat parsers to handle files in any encoding supported by Python, and various bugfixes for SAX, DOM, and the `minidom` module.

  * Ping also contributed another hook for handling uncaught exceptions. [`sys.excepthook()`](3.标准库/sys.md#sys.excepthook "sys.excepthook") can be set to a callable object. When an exception isn't caught by any [`try`](8.%20复合语句.md#try)...[`except`](8.%20复合语句.md#except) blocks, the exception will be passed to [`sys.excepthook()`](3.标准库/sys.md#sys.excepthook "sys.excepthook"), which can then do whatever it likes. At the Ninth Python Conference, Ping demonstrated an application for this hook: printing an extended traceback that not only lists the stack frames, but also lists the function arguments and the local variables for each frame.

  * Various functions in the [`time`](time.md#module-time "time: Time access and conversions.") module, such as `asctime()` and `localtime()`, require a floating point argument containing the time in seconds since the epoch. The most common use of these functions is to work with the current time, so the floating point argument has been made optional; when a value isn't provided, the current time will be used. For example, log file entries usually need a string containing the current time; in Python 2.1, `time.asctime()` can be used, instead of the lengthier `time.asctime(time.localtime(time.time()))` that was previously required.

This change was proposed and implemented by Thomas Wouters.

  * The [`ftplib`](ftplib.md#module-ftplib "ftplib: FTP protocol client \(requires sockets\).") module now defaults to retrieving files in passive mode, because passive mode is more likely to work from behind a firewall. This request came from the Debian bug tracking system, since other Debian packages use [`ftplib`](ftplib.md#module-ftplib "ftplib: FTP protocol client \(requires sockets\).") to retrieve files and then don't work from behind a firewall. It's deemed unlikely that this will cause problems for anyone, because Netscape defaults to passive mode and few people complain, but if passive mode is unsuitable for your application or network setup, call `set_pasv(0)` on FTP objects to disable passive mode.

  * Support for raw socket access has been added to the [`socket`](socket.md#module-socket "socket: Low-level networking interface.") module, contributed by Grant Edwards.

  * The [`pstats`](profile.md#module-pstats "pstats: Statistics object for use with the profiler.") module now contains a simple interactive statistics browser for displaying timing profiles for Python programs, invoked when the module is run as a script. Contributed by Eric S. Raymond.

  * A new implementation-dependent function, `sys._getframe([depth])`, has been added to return a given frame object from the current call stack. [`sys._getframe()`](3.标准库/sys.md#sys._getframe "sys._getframe") returns the frame at the top of the call stack; if the optional integer argument _depth_ is supplied, the function returns the frame that is _depth_ calls below the top of the stack. For example, `sys._getframe(1)` returns the caller's frame object.

This function is only present in CPython, not in Jython or the .NET implementation. Use it for debugging, and resist the temptation to put it into production code.

## 其他的改变和修正¶

There were relatively few smaller changes made in Python 2.1 due to the shorter release cycle. A search through the CVS change logs turns up 117 patches applied, and 136 bugs fixed; both figures are likely to be underestimates. Some of the more notable changes are:

  * A specialized object allocator is now optionally available, that should be faster than the system `malloc()` and have less memory overhead. The allocator uses C's `malloc()` function to get large pools of memory, and then fulfills smaller memory requests from these pools. It can be enabled by providing the `--with-pymalloc` option to the **configure** script; see `Objects/obmalloc.c` for the implementation details.

Authors of C extension modules should test their code with the object allocator enabled, because some incorrect code may break, causing core dumps at runtime. There are a bunch of memory allocation functions in Python's C API that have previously been just aliases for the C library's `malloc()` and `free()`, meaning that if you accidentally called mismatched functions, the error wouldn't be noticeable. When the object allocator is enabled, these functions aren't aliases of `malloc()` and `free()` any more, and calling the wrong function to free memory will get you a core dump. For example, if memory was allocated using [`PyMem_New`](memory.md#c.PyMem_New "PyMem_New"), it has to be freed using [`PyMem_Del()`](memory.md#c.PyMem_Del "PyMem_Del"), not `free()`. A few modules included with Python fell afoul of this and had to be fixed; doubtless there are more third-party modules that will have the same problem.

The object allocator was contributed by Vladimir Marangozov.

  * The speed of line-oriented file I/O has been improved because people often complain about its lack of speed, and because it's often been used as a naïve benchmark. The [`readline()`](readline.md#module-readline "readline: GNU readline support for Python. \(Unix\)") method of file objects has therefore been rewritten to be much faster. The exact amount of the speedup will vary from platform to platform depending on how slow the C library's `getc()` was, but is around 66%, and potentially much faster on some particular operating systems. Tim Peters did much of the benchmarking and coding for this change, motivated by a discussion in comp.lang.python.

A new module and method for file objects was also added, contributed by Jeff Epler. The new method, `xreadlines()`, is similar to the existing `xrange()` built-in. `xreadlines()` returns an opaque sequence object that only supports being iterated over, reading a line on every iteration but not reading the entire file into memory as the existing `readlines()` method does. You'd use it like this:

    
        for line in sys.stdin.xreadlines():
        # ... do something for each line ...
        ...
    

For a fuller discussion of the line I/O changes, see the python-dev summary for January 1--15, 2001 at <https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2001-January/>.

  * A new method, `popitem()`, was added to dictionaries to enable destructively iterating through the contents of a dictionary; this can be faster for large dictionaries because there's no need to construct a list containing all the keys or values. `D.popitem()` removes a random `(key, value)` pair from the dictionary `D` and returns it as a 2-tuple. This was implemented mostly by Tim Peters and Guido van Rossum, after a suggestion and preliminary patch by Moshe Zadka.

  * Modules can now control which names are imported when `from module import *` is used, by defining an `__all__` attribute containing a list of names that will be imported. One common complaint is that if the module imports other modules such as [`sys`](3.标准库/sys.md#module-sys "sys: Access system-specific parameters and functions.") or [`string`](string.md#module-string "string: Common string operations."), `from module import *` will add them to the importing module's namespace. To fix this, simply list the public names in `__all__`:
    
        # List public names
    __all__ = ['Database', 'open']
    

A stricter version of this patch was first suggested and implemented by Ben Wolfson, but after some python-dev discussion, a weaker final version was checked in.

  * Applying [`repr()`](functions.md#repr "repr") to strings previously used octal escapes for non-printable characters; for example, a newline was `'\012'`. This was a vestigial trace of Python's C ancestry, but today octal is of very little practical use. Ka-Ping Yee suggested using hex escapes instead of octal ones, and using the `\n`, `\t`, `\r` escapes for the appropriate characters, and implemented this new formatting.

  * Syntax errors detected at compile-time can now raise exceptions containing the filename and line number of the error, a pleasant side effect of the compiler reorganization done by Jeremy Hylton.

  * C extensions which import other modules have been changed to use [`PyImport_ImportModule()`](10.C%20API接口/import.md#c.PyImport_ImportModule "PyImport_ImportModule"), which means that they will use any import hooks that have been installed. This is also encouraged for third-party extensions that need to import some other module from C code.

  * The size of the Unicode character database was shrunk by another 340K thanks to Fredrik Lundh.

  * Some new ports were contributed: MacOS X (by Steven Majewski), Cygwin (by Jason Tishler); RISCOS (by Dietmar Schwertberger); Unixware 7 (by Billy G. Allie).

And there's the usual list of minor bugfixes, minor memory leaks, docstring edits, and other tweaks, too lengthy to be worth itemizing; see the CVS logs for the full details if you want them.
